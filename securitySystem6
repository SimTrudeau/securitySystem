 The purpose of this program is to run an arduino based security system.
At this point it is just to test concepts.
An ultrasonic transciever is hooked up to a breadboard along with a passive buzzer and two LED's which are red and green.
Under normal circumstances, the green light will be on along with the ultrasonic sensor.
Should the sensor determine that an object is within a certain proximity, the light switches from red to green.
If it gets even closer, past a second predetermined point, the red light remains on and the buzzer sounds.

The order which the previous items are connected to the breadboard is arbitrary at this point.
